# Roombaba

[Demo](https://roombaba-1cc0c.firebaseapp.com)

## Goal

The goal of the application is to take the room dimensions, the locations of the dirt patches, and the hoover location as input and to allow the user to navigate the robot around the room.

As a **minimum** you should build an interface with:

* A way to enter the following configuration:
  * the room dimensions (length and width)
  * the starting location of the robot (as coordinates)
  * the locations of zero or more dirt patches
* Four buttons which will move the robot North, South, East and West 
* A representation of the robot's position within the room
* A representation of the number of dirt patches which have been hoovered

## Features
- Use WSAD or the buttons to move the Roombaba around the room
